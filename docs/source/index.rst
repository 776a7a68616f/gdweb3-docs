Description
-----------
**GDWeb3** aims to help Godot game developers easily interact with blockchain networks, empowering them to develop Gamefi and FOCG (full on-chain games).

However, supporting all blockchain networks at once is not feasible. At this stage, our primary focus is on the `Optimism Network <https://www.optimism.io/>`_. `Optimism`'s performance as an ETH Layer 2 solution is excellent, and it has a strong ecosystem.

* We believe that supporting a network with promising development will attract game developers to continue building.

* We believe that the unique creativity and boundless ideas of game developers will accelerate the development of the web3 gaming industry.

Being able to provide assistance to them and, perhaps one day, play enjoyable FOCG games is the joy we find in maintaining this project.


About Godot Engine
------------------
Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine that allows users to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, allowing users to focus on making games without reinventing the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to various platforms, including major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), web-based platforms, and consoles.

Godot is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT license. Users' games belong to them, down to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering users to shape the engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the Godot Foundation, a not-for-profit organization.

Support Godot Version
---------------------
At this stage, we are developing based on **4.3.0-stable** version. Currently, we only guarantee upward compatibility. Therefore, when you use the program compiled from this project to extend development on older game projects, please pay attention to the version number of the Godot engine program you originally used.
