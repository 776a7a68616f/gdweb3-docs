Getting Started
===============

The project is developed using the basic capabilities of Godot Engine's custom C++ modules.

`Custom C++ Modules <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/core_and_modules/custom_modules_in_cpp.html>`_

Based on this capability, we can directly use C++ to implement code without worrying about the performance loss of using GDScript. At the same time, game developers can also use GDScript directly, and the underlying code will eventually be displayed in GDScript.

.. note::

   Thanks to the Godot team for their excellent work!

Since GDWeb3 has not yet been merged into the main branch of Godot (this may become possible in the future), you need to recompile the engine or use our precompiled engine program.

There are two different starting paths you can choose from:

1. If you want to build from source or contribute to development, you can start from the :doc:`Compiling From Source <compiling_from_source>`.

2. If you want to directly use the compiled tools and learn how to develop games with GDWeb3, you can start from the :doc:`Hello Optimism <hello_optimism>`. Here is a simple tutorial, just like **Hello World**.
